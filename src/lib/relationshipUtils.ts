// This file previously housed `calculateUserCentricRelationshipDetails`.
// With kinkonnect_logic2, complex user-centric relationship strings are no longer
// the primary way relationships are stored or determined for the tree structure.
// The tree relies on fatherId, motherId, and spouseIds.

// This file can be repurposed or used for utility functions related to the graph,
// such as generating human-readable labels from a path if needed elsewhere in the app,
// but it's not central to building the tree visualization's core links anymore.

// Example of a potential future function (NOT USED BY THE TREE VISUALIZATION CURRENTLY):
/*
export function generateUserCentricLabelFromPath(path: string[]): string {
  // path could be like ['father', 'mother', 'father']
  // logic to convert this to "Maternal Great-Grandfather" etc.
  if (path.length === 0) return "Self";
  // ... more complex logic ...
  return "Relative";
}
*/

// For now, this file might not export much, or helper functions specific to graph manipulation if needed.
// The primary logic for setting fatherId/motherId/spouseIds during member creation
// will now reside in FamilyMemberForm.tsx and be executed by firestore.ts.

export {}; // Keep it as a module
